[mmu_encoder mmu_encoder]
encoder_pin: ^mmu:MMU_ENCODER		# EASY-BRD: ^PA6, Flytech ERB: ^gpio22
encoder_resolution: 1.0			    # This is just a starter value. Overriden by `mmu_encoder_resolution` in mmm_vars.cfg
desired_headroom: 5.0		     	# The clog/runout headroom that MMU will attempt to maintain (closest MMU comes to triggering runout)
average_samples: 4			        # The "damping" effect of the last measurement. A higher value means clog_length will be reduced more slowly
flowrate_samples: 20			    # How many "movements" on the encoder to measure over for flowrate calc
